# Project2 - ABBA Quiz
<p> Project 2 required a website that included a Javascript Quiz. I chose to make a quiz based on my favourtie band; ABBA! The website has a simple & easy to navigate layout. I have designed the website using typical ABBA colours with the main colour being Gold.</p>
<h1> Features </h1>
<h3> All Pages </h3>
<ul> 
<li> Navigation Bar - A Bootstrap Nav-Bar which allows users to navigate easily around the website by clicking each navigation link, which will then take them to the relevant page. This collapses into a hamburger menu when the page size is reduced.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
<li> HTML5 - The project uses <b>HTML5</b> to create the basic elements and content of the website.</li>
<li> CSS3 - The project uses <b>CSS3</b> to add my desired styles to the elements and content of the website.</li>
  <li> Javascript - The project uses <b>Javascript</b> tocreate the quiz in this website. </li>
  <li> Bootstrap - 
<li> Google Fonts - The project uses <b>Google Fonts</b> to run in theme with the rest of my websiste.</li>
<li> Font Awesome - The project uses <b>Font Awesome</b> to inlcude Icons used in the Nav-Bar and Footer. </li>
<li> Git - I used <b>Git</b> to regularly push and commit changes in the project.</li>
<li> GitHub - I used <b>GitHub</b> as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I have also used GitHub to create the README.md file.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Responsive Testing</h1>
I used Mac Safari and Google Chome's development tool's to test the responsiveness of my website on different sized devices.
<h3>HTML,CSS & Javascript Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used the <b>W3C HTML Validator</b> tool to validate my HTML code.</li>
<li>I used the <b>W3C CSS Validator</b> tool to validate my CSS code.</li>
<li> I used <b>https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate </b> to validate my Javascript code. </li>
</ul>
<h1> Deployment </h1>
<p> The website was created using <b>Sublime Text</b>, a local git directory was used for version control and then uploaded to Git. I used 'git init' to initiate the git repository, 'git add .' & 'git commit -m "message goes here"' which would add a message with the information of what changes were made folowed by 'git push origin master' to push the changes to the repoistory.  I did this every time changes were made, however unfortunately I lost a lot of commit's during the process due to an error I struggled to fix near the end of the project. Once the website was finished I used Git Pages to make the website live.</p>
