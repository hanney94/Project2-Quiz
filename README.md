# Project2 - ABBA Quiz
<p> Project 2 required a website that included a Javascript Quiz. I chose to make a quiz based on my favourtie band; ABBA! The website has a simple & easy to navigate layout. I have designed the website using typical ABBA colours with the main colour being Gold.</p>
<h1> Features </h1>
<h3> All Pages </h3>
<ul> 
<li> Navigation Bar - A Bootstrap Nav-Bar which allows users to navigate easily around the website by clicking each navigation link, which will then take them to the relevant page. This collapses into a hamburger menu when the page size is reduced.</li>
<li> Footer - A Bootstrap footer at the bottom of each page with my name and the year I created the website. </li>
</ul>
<h3> index.html </h3>
<ul>
<li> Image - a large image of the band.
